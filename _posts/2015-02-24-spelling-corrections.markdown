[App Details!][1]


Wrote a simple AngularJS, Model-View-Controller web UI that invoked a Python/Flask based server implementing a REST API.


The REST API implemented a set of simple algorithms based on Levenshtein distance applied to strings to suggest possible spelling corrections for misspelled words. The Python/Flask service recorded common misspellings to augment the LD heuristics.
